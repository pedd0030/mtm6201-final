# Portfolio Reflection

The process in creating my web portfolio was long, challenging, and time consuming. Learning bootstrap even for the minimal amount of it I used was quite difficult for me. I was able to overcome some of the issues I faced with the internet, help from peers, but mainly trial and error was the thing that helped me the most. I had to make a lot of compromises  but I believe I was still able to deliver a somewhat suitable website. Throughout, I have learned an okay amount of bootstrap but I want to keep my bootstrap knowledge going because I am realizing only now how useful it is. If I can keep figuring out more bootstrap I can see it reducing my worktime for making different elements of a website like nav, grids, etc to almost nothing. All in all this project was quite the challenge but allowed me to learn so much about bootstrap and regular css and html.
